# canvas-snake

A simple retro snake game, written in JavaScript, with the game rendered on an HTML canvas and hi-scores in HTML local storage.

Play it here: [https://www.mpatric.com/canvas-snake](https://www.mpatric.com/canvas-snake)

I've also ported the same game to CoffeeScript: [https://github.com/mpatric/canvas-snake-coffeescript](https://github.com/mpatric/canvas-snake-coffeescript).
